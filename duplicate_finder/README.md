# Duplicate_finder

A python script for finding duplicate files among a selected amount of folders. This script also handles having folders from which it will not delete. 

There is also an option that will run without deleting, if selected it will output a json file containing a dictionary of all duplicate files.

Currently the deletion is not working amazingly, so i dont recommend using it as of the moment. All deletion is being sent to the trash
