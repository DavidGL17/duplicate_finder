# Webp_converter

A python script for converting all .webp files in a set of directories to .png. This script will copy first the files to a directory (`copy_dir`) located at the place where this script is called, to enable the possibility to fix any error.

Currently the conversion is hardcoded, because there is no other format type i need automated conversion for.
