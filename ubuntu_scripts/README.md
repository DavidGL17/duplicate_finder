# Fedora scripts

These scripts are the ones I use to maintain my ubuntu machine up to date.

-   run_update : pretty straightforward, just updates the system with apt-get, and will clean cache and remove useless dependencies aswell

# Install

To install these scripts, just execute `./setup.sh`. It will copy the scripts to /usr/bin
