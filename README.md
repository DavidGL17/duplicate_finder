# Personal scripts

A repo containing various personal scripts. Each script is described in it's folder's README.

# Contribution

This is mainly a personal project, but all contribution is welcomed, and you can certainly use these scripts on your own if you think they will be useful for you. I do not guarantee that they all work though.
